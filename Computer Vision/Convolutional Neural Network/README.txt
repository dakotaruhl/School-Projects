I had some trouble with the task1.m script not finding 00_common files that are neccesary to run the script,
like readgray - and detection functions. Make sure to add 00_common/utilities, 00_common/detection, and 
00_common/images if it gives you any trouble. 

Sometimes the accuracy comes out as 1 and does not display correctly (shows a box). 
The bounding boxes for the faces don't seem to be correctly positioned. 

Other than those two, it runs pretty well on my end.
