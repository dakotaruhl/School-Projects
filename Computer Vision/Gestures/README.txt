The code is dependant on one function i created [result] = cost(M, Q, i, j) 
The function i created is Cost, and it just returns the euclidian distance of two matricies, given the coordantes
(i,j) for two coordinate matricies M and Q respectively. 

Both functions have the given dataset included, if you want to run them like a script. 
Uncomment the sequence1 and sequence2 values, highlight the function (not including the last 'end') and press
f9 to run. This is what i did for testing.
